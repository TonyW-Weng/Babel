# Babel
I will split this into two paragraphs, the first one is what the game should've been (If I had more time and wasn't going insane) and the second one is what the current state is

First Paragraph
Babel
The specical features of my project (A game) are the hexagonal board, 2D gameplay (Most rougelike I played were a 1D direction kinda board where there isn't a in battle movement feature) and deity selection. The deity selection was my take on a class selection where it allowed the player to specialize their run or they could've choosen to go without a deity which would've been a harder challenge because of lore reasons (No deity = no buffs and all the rest kinda hate you b/c they do in fact, exist). The movenment was added to allow for a more complex and planning sytle of gameplay where you aren't just manging your cards and stamina as a resource but also your position and how to control the field to allow for easier clearing of a stage. The hexagonal board was made for more movenment opportunities while also serving as a way for planning b/c it had much easier connections for the player to follow and also made some math easier.

Second Paragraph
Babel
With the current game state, the special features are the hexagonal board, 2d gameplay (Stated above but here it is again: Most rougelike I played were a 1D direction kinda board where there isn't a in battle movement feature). Some features added after removing some were regarding the enemy AI in which they will stack up on top of each other which would allow to go for more risky plays if they so choose (If they end their turn within range, they are absolutly cooked). I also made it so enemies would spawn on different tiles between stages which add a level of positioning / planning.
